            Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics dealing with phenomena at very small scales...
            The Theories that Describe our Universe
	Modern understanding of our universe tells us that it can be modelled by two theories: The Theory of General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory. These theories describe the events in our universe at their respective scales. The holy grail of theoretical physics is to devise a universal theory: one that unites quantum field theory with general relativity and incorporates all the fundamental constants of nature; a “theory of everything
General relativity:
The Theory of General Relativity focuses on physics at a large scale, describing the behaviour of planets and large masses in the universe. It can be thought of as describing the fabric of the universe as a surface, spacetime that can be bent by large masses, causing gravitation. But in reality, spacetime is a four-dimensional entity, three dimensions of space, and one dimension of time. Gravitation, in this framework, is not a force, but the result of the curvature of spacetime on the motion of bodies; this curvature is caused by large masses like planets. It can be visualised by imagining what would happen if you placed a heavy ball on a trampoline; the surface of the trampoline, representing spacetime, would sink and bend as a result of the ball, representing a planet.
The idea of spacetime curvature paves the way for another aspect of general relativity that is extremely important in the phenomenon of Hawking Radiation. This is the idea that measurements of space and time are not absolute. For all observers, the laws of physics never change, but their measurements of space and time do. This is called ‘Gravitational Time Dilation’. What these phenomena describe is how space and time can be measured differently depending on the observer. For example, time appears to move more slowly for an observer within a strong gravitational field than it does for one floating freely in space.

Quantum Field Theory:
Quantum Field Theory focuses on events and systems on a much smaller, sub-atomic level. One of the core elements of Quantum Field Theory is quantum mechanics, which states that, unlike normal objects, which have a definite position in space, according to quantum mechanics, particles do not have definite positions; quantum particles exist in a superposition of possible states. Their presence is distributed across space in all of their possible positions, each with varying levels of possibility of finding that particle in a particular location. This can be summarised by stating that quantum mechanics uses the wave function, a mathematical object that encodes the probability amplitudes for all possible positions of that particle, to describe particles, rather than bodies with definite positions.
There is another detail in Quantum Field Theory that is important to the understanding of Hawking Radiation. This is how it describes vacuums, and what we think of as ‘empty space’. In quantum field theory, Vacuum Fluctuations fill this ‘empty’ space. A vacuum fluctuation is where a particle-antiparticle pair comes into existence and then annihilates extremely soon after coming into existence. These particles are referred to as virtual particles. And when we revisit quantum mechanics and describe these particles as waves of probability, we find ourselves with a vacuum where a wave comes into existence at the same instant as one that is effectively the opposite. It is important to note that virtual particles are not physically real particles or waves, just mathematical tools which we use to represent fluctuations in the quantum field.
