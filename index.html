        <h1>My Research Projects</h1>
        <p>My Name is Daniel Bickerdike, and I like Physics.<br><br> My interest in this science has led me to read about a lot of different things. And I often like to turn that reading into a project for myself, where I will write a short piece on whatever phenomenon is currently fascinating me. <br><br> And here is where you can read them too (or not if you have better things to do). <br><br>So, please, click on a project below to read it.</p>
